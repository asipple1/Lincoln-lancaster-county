<p><strong><h3>May I send mail to an inmate?</h3></strong>
Inmates may generally correspond through the mail with whomever they choose, as long as the correspondence does not jeopardize the public or facility safety or security. Incoming mail will not be delivered to inmates if it contains contraband items, stickers, stamps, or stains. Books and magazines must be sent directly from a publisher. Inmates may purchase envelopes and stamps from commissary, so these items will not be given to inmates if received in the mail.
